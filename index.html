								<p>My name is Husain Badri, as you all know, I reside in the city of Surat, Gujrat, India. I am extremely fortunate that I study in the university of Al Jamea Tus Saifiyah, which has been built by our passed away Spiritual leader Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin (RA) and today it is being directed by our Spiritual leader Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin (TUS).(The photo displayed above is the university of Al Jamea Tus Saifiyah, Surat)</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\jamea2moula.jpg" alt="Moula" /></span>
								<p>In the guidance and suprvision of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin (TUS), we the students of the university gain knowledge of both worlds. Firstly studies regarding our religion and secondly studies of worldly affairs and sciences. We are also blessed that we get to learn diffrent types of skills such as web development, catering, interior designing, voice culture, robotics, carpentry and many more. Talking about myself, I am really fond of learning skills regrding comptuters and web designing. Last year I took the course of web designing in which we studied about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have also done many projects and work. Some of them are described in the work section <a href="#work">check it out.</a>.</p>
